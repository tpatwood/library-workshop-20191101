# netsl-2019-demo

This is the repo for a presentation/demo given at the New England Technical Services Librarians Annual Spring Conference, 2019, in Worcester, MA. 

This repo contains three things in addition to this README file: 

* PITCHME.md - this is the file that will render into the presentation slides, available here: https://gitpitch.com/tpatwood/netsl-2019-demo 
* lessonHandout-git.doc - this is the handout that accompanies the presentation
* lessonNotes-git.doc - my notes for the presentation. 

This presentation is based significantly off of the Library Carpentry, availalbe here: https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-git/ 

Thanks! :-)
