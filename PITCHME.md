### What I've done ahead of our workshop...

I have: 

@ul[]
- Setup my own GitHub account (at [GitHub.com](https://github.com))
- Downloaded, installed, and configured my Git setup. 
- Set up a couple of default items in my Git instance, so I won't need to sign in to save and share my work with GitHub.

### Intro to version control

<br>Keep multiple versions of files available to look at previous edits, ideas, comments, and more. 
<br>Figure out which version of a digital object is the most current version

### Git & GitHub

@ul[]
- *Git* - a free, open source version control system. Logs changes made to files on your machine. Files you want to track are designated in a Git Repository (or "Git repo")
- *GitHub* - a popular website for hosting and sharing Git repositories.

### Git commands and navigating in the command line

<br> Demo time! We'll do some neat stuff like:

@ul[]
- Navigate around our computer
- Create a new directory
- Create a git repository
- Track files
- Version control our files (with a handy command called _git commit_)
- Check on the status of our work
- ... and more!
@ulend

### Sharing your work 

<br> Demo time! We'll do some neat stuff: 

@ul[](false)
- Connect our local repository to our shared repository on GitHub
- Share our work with the repository on GitHub
- Look at the changes between different versions of our files
- Grab changes made by our collaborators and merge them into the working document on our computer
